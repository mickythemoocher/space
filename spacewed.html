<font color="#0000FF">Peterr:</font color="#0000FF"> Look! Look! The ship. It is almost all under water now.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Charlie:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh my gosh, we were so lucky to swim to this island.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Steph: </font color="#0000FF">It was such a long swim.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mickey: </font color="#0000FF">Yes it was but we all made it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty:</font color="#0000FF"> I am exhausted after swimming so far.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Charlie:</font color="#0000FF"> Me too but now we can relax on this beautiful beach for a while.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">Aren't we lucky to have been so close to this beautiful island.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Steph:</font color="#0000FF"> It is but do you think it will take long till we are rescued<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">No way of knowing that Steph.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Charlie:</font color="#0000FF"> People will know that the ship sank so hopefully they will soon start looking for us.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty: </font color="#0000FF">So we could be stuck here all night?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">Actually Betty it could b much longer than that.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty:</font color="#0000FF"> How long Peter?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">It really is too difficult to say.
<font color="#0000FF">Charlie:</font color="#0000FF"> Peter is right. We could actually be here for quite a while.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Micky: </font color="#0000FF">well we won't freeze that's for sure. It is very warm.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Steph: </font color="#0000FF">Yes the weather is lovely.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Micky: </font color="#0000FF">Peter, if you are right and we could be here for a while, we should try to get organised.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty:</font color="#0000FF"> What do you mean? Organised? What is there to organise?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter:</font color="#0000FF"> Micky is right. If we are here for a while we need to fend for ourselves. There are no adults to look after us.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty:</font color="#0000FF"> I see what you mean.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Charlie:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, this is true. We need food, water and shelter at least.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Steph:</font color="#0000FF"> Of course! We are so used to our mums and dads doing things like that but now we have to do it for ourselves.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Micky: </font color="#0000FF">So we can't just lie here on this beach all day.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">That's true, by nightfall we will definitely need food water and shelter.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty:</font color="#0000FF"> so we need to explore the island then<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Steph: </font color="#0000FF">Yes I suppose that would be the first thing to do.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">I think we ought to organise other things first.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Micky:</font color="#0000FF"> What do you mean Peter, surely they are the most important things.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">Yes, they are important but unless we are careful we will be approaching this in the wrong way.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty: </font color="#0000FF">What do you mean by that?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter:</font color="#0000FF"> What I mean is we don't want to all go off willy nilly looking for things without organising ourselves properly first. Otherwise I think we will just be falling over each other and nobody knowing what they should be doing<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Micky: </font color="#0000FF">Ok, that is quite a good point.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Steph: </font color="#0000FF">Yes it is. So what do you suggest Peter?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">This may sound a little crazy but as you can see we appear to have this island all to ourselves.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Charlie:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, it does seem that way.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty:</font color="#0000FF"> So what are you suggesting Peter?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter:</font color="#0000FF"> We arrived here by accident but really, now, It is like our own country?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mickey:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh yes! It is<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Steph: </font color="#0000FF">Yes, how exciting.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty:</font color="#0000FF"> It is exciting but what does it mean?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">Well all countries have governments don't they?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Charlie: </font color="#0000FF">Yes, that is true.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Steph: </font color="#0000FF">So are you saying we should have a government Peter: Exactly. That is what I meant by organising ourselves.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Micky:</font color="#0000FF"> Ok, I get it but a government is elected by the people of the country, and we are the only people.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">That is true but I still think we can be responsible for different things.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty: </font color="#0000FF">That sounds like a good idea<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Steph: </font color="#0000FF">Maybe difficult to do though.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">I don't think so. You see, all governments have ministers. They are people that take charge of different departments to help the country run smoothly.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Micky:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, I have heard that.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty: </font color="#0000FF">So what ministers would we need in our new country?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter:</font color="#0000FF"> I have already thought about this. Firstly there would be the Prime Minister. He is in charge of all the others.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Steph: </font color="#0000FF">The top job?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">Yes.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Micky: </font color="#0000FF">What others would there be in our country?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">I was thinking a minister for food, one for shelter, one for water and one to concentrate on rescue.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty: </font color="#0000FF">And of course the Prime Minister<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">Yes.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Steph: </font color="#0000FF">So a role for all five of us?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">Exactly.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Micky: </font color="#0000FF">So how would we decide who has what role?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter:</font color="#0000FF"> That would be the difficult part.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Charlie: </font color="#0000FF">I guess everyone would want the top job?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Steph:</font color="#0000FF"> Of course!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter:</font color="#0000FF"> I though the easiest way was to elect a Prime Minister first and he would decide who the others would be.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Charlie:</font color="#0000FF"> That seems like a good idea.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty: </font color="#0000FF">So how do we elect the Prime Minister? Anyone have any ideas?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Charlie: </font color="#0000FF">I think the eldest amongst us should have that role.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Steph: </font color="#0000FF">I would agree with that?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty:</font color="#0000FF"> Me too.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Micky: </font color="#0000FF">Peter, you are the eldest, will you be prime minister?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">Of course, I will.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty:</font color="#0000FF"> So who will be your new ministers Peter?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">Well let me see now, this may not be an easy task.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Charlie:</font color="#0000FF"> Maybe we could choose which one we want to be?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Steph: </font color="#0000FF">That's a good idea<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">It would be as long as everyone doesn't want the same post<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Micky:</font color="#0000FF"> That's true.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter:</font color="#0000FF"> I have an idea though, I will ask for volunteers for each role.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Charlie: </font color="#0000FF">Yes! That could work.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">So let's see if we can do it this way?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty:</font color="#0000FF"> This is exciting!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">So let's start with the minister of food. Would anyone like that post?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Steph: </font color="#0000FF">I think I would be good at that. My mum likes to pick things from the woods near our house, like mushrooms and berries and I have helped her do that.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">Wicked! Just what we want. So Steph you are the new minister for food?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Charlie:</font color="#0000FF"> We can't survive on just mushrooms and berries though.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Steph: </font color="#0000FF">Of course not but last year my dad taught me to fish so I will do that too.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty: </font color="#0000FF">Oh good! I love fish<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: Me too so I think you will be a great minister of food Steph.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Steph: </font color="#0000FF">Thank you.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">Next is the minister of water. There is plenty of sea water but of course we can't drink that.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty: </font color="#0000FF">Yuck!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Charlie: </font color="#0000FF">What exactly would the minister for water do Peter?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter:</font color="#0000FF"> Mostly it will be exploring. Trying to find a river or lake on the island for fresh water.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty: </font color="#0000FF">That sounds a bit dangerous, who knows what is on this island.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Charlie: </font color="#0000FF">I'd like to be minister of water Peter: I am nmot afraid of exploring and I will be very careful to keep safe.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter. </font color="#0000FF">Very well then Charlie, you are the minister for water. Now even though we will all have our separate jobs, that doesn't mean we can't help each other so it maybe a good idea to take one ot he other with you.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Charlie: </font color="#0000FF">Ok I'll do that. See that big hill behind us? I think there could be water over there. Maybe a river flowing down the hill.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Steph: </font color="#0000FF">Good plan Charlie.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">Next we need a minister for shelter. Something to protect us a bit from the cold and night and shelter us if it rains.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mickey: </font color="#0000FF">My dad says I am quite good at building things, and I did once make a camp in our garden.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">Ok Micky the job is yours. I think it will be a very tricky job, so as prime minister, I will help you with that.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mickey:</font color="#0000FF"> Ok peter that sounds good.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty:</font color="#0000FF"> As all the other posts have been taken I will be minister of rescue then?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter:</font color="#0000FF"> Are you happy with that Betty?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty: </font color="#0000FF">Yes, I have ideas already.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Steph: </font color="#0000FF">Wow! That was quick Betty. What are your ideas?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Charlie: </font color="#0000FF">Yes tell us how will we be rescued?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty: </font color="#0000FF">The first thing I will do is collect lots of pebbles from the beach, as large as possible, and lay them out to spell 'HELP'. If a plane fries over hopefully they will see it and send someone to rescue us.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">Great idea Betty<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Charlie: </font color="#0000FF">Yes! That sounds like just what we need.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty: </font color="#0000FF">Also I need to gather some wood and dry bushes to build a big fire. Someone may see either the fames or even the smoke.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mickey: </font color="#0000FF">Another good idea Betty.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty: </font color="#0000FF">Trouble is we probably don't have anything to light the fire with.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Charlie: </font color="#0000FF">I can help with this, look, I have a magnifying glass in my pocket<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mickey: </font color="#0000FF">Yes, that would do it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Charlie: </font color="#0000FF">We can direct some sunlight onto some dry twigs and it should get hot enough to start fire<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty: </font color="#0000FF">Oh great! Will you help me with that then Charlie?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Charlie: </font color="#0000FF">Yes, of course.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">Well that was so much easier than I expected. There is one more thing that we should do though.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Steph: </font color="#0000FF">What's that Peter?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">We have a brand new government in a brand new country. But our country hasn't got a name. What shall we call it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty: </font color="#0000FF">Oh gosh! Yes, we have to give our new country a name.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Charlie: </font color="#0000FF">Something grand and important.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Steph: </font color="#0000FF">Yes, but not too long though, something we can all remember.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mickey:</font color="#0000FF">A name we can be proud of.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">As Prime Minister may I suggested – Makanrushi?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mickey: </font color="#0000FF">I like that, it has a good ring to it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty:</font color="#0000FF"> It sounds very grand.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Charlie:</font color="#0000FF">I think that is a winner Peter.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Steph: </font color="#0000FF">How did you think of that?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">At school one day we had a geography lesson about uninhabited islands in the South Pacific. Places where nobody lives. Who knows? This could be that very island,<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Steph: </font color="#0000FF">Great choice. Here's to our new country, Makanrushi.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">So let's get to work – Oh oh – too late, look who I can see?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mummy: </font color="#0000FF">Peter, Betty, come on in, it's time for tea.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Betty: </font color="#0000FF">Oh mum! We were having such a fun game can we stay a little longer?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mummy. </font color="#0000FF">No dears, it will be dark soon, so say goodbye to your friends and come in for your tea<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Peter: </font color="#0000FF">Ok mum, Goodbye everyone.

(They all call out goodbyes)<p>
